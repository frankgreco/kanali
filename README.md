Kanali is a lightweight, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) native API management gateway that together with network policies provide a robust, open source solution to Kubernetes ingress, API management, and API security.

Notable features:

* **Kubernetes Native:** Kanali extends the Kubernetes API by using [Custom Resource Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions), allowing Kanali to be configured and used in the same way as native Kubernetes resources.
* **Performance Centric:** As a middleware component, Kanali is developed with performance as the highest priority!
* **Plugin Framework:** Need to perform complex transformations or integrations with a legacy system? Kanali provides a framework allowing developers to create, integrate, and version control custom plugins.
* **User-Defined Configurations:** Kanali gives you control over declaratively configuring how your proxy behaves. Need mutual TLS, dynamic service discovery, mock responses, etc.? Kanali makes it easy!
* **Robust API Management:** Fine grained API key authorization, JWT validation, quota policies, rate limiting, etc., these are some of the built in API management capabilities that Kanali provides.
* **Analytics & Monitoring:** Kanali integrates with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) to provide a robust set of metrics and a customizable dashboard so that you can monitor the performance of your APIs in real time.
* **Production Ready:** [Northwestern Mutual](https://www.northwesternmutual.com/) uses Kanali in production at scale for all of its API management needs in their cloud native stack.
* **Cloud Native Deployment:** Kanali is deployed using native Kubernetes constructs which is assisted by an included Helm [chart](https://github.com/frankgreco/kanali/tree/master/helm/kanali).
* **Open Tracing Integration:** Kanali integrates with [OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io/), a vendor-neutral open standard for distributed tracing. [Jaeger](http://jaeger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a distributed tracing system, is supported out of the box to provide a visual representation for your traces.
